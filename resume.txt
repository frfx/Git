My 4 years of foreign experience on the semiconductor industry gave me a proven record in complex technical development, where I had to show adaptability in a strong international environment. Part of a highly competitive department, I had to demonstrate innovative solutions to meet the project schedules. 
In my current position in Sercel, I have developed my skills in understanding technical customer requirements where I have gained considerable knowledge on the constraints of offshore environments. With a strong analytical mind, I succeeded in facing urgent issues requiring fast decisional capabilities.  
I aim at mastering systems in keeping with its performance objectives  in terms of quality, cost, lead-times and value of the services.
